The Grey Cup is a championship game that determines who is the best team in Canada's Canadian Football League (CFL). Since Justin Bieber was born in Ontario, it makes sense that he would be a fan of the Toronto Argonauts. However, his hometown is also the birthplace of the National Football League, which means that Justin Bieber was also likely to be interested in American football as well. In fact, American football is so popular in Canada that many Canadian football players have gone on to play for NFL teams. So, let's see who won the Super Bowl in 1994 - when Justin Bieber was one month old: The San Francisco 49ers beat the San Diego Chargers 49-26 and won their sixth Super Bowl title.\""
